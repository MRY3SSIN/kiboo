## Customizing the App

### Modifying Mock Data

Edit `src/data/mockData.ts` to customize:

1. **Add more students**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'st7',
  name: 'Your Student Name',
  avatar: 'ðŸ‘¦', // or 'ðŸ‘§'
  classId: 'c1',
  overallScore: 85,
  attendance: 95,
  // ... more fields
}
```

2. **Add new classes**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'c4',
  name: 'Class 7A',
  grade: '7th Grade',
  studentCount: 20,
  // ... more fields
}
```

3. **Change subjects**:
```typescript
{ id: 's6', name: 'Music', color: '#EC4899' }
```

### Changing Colors

Each component has inline styles. Look for `StyleSheet.create()` at the bottom of component files.

Main brand color: `#3B82F6` (blue) - change this throughout for a different theme.

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Make sure you ran `npm install`
- Try clearing cache: `expo start -c`

### QR code won't scan
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Try the "Tunnel" connection option in Expo

### Styles look weird
- This app is optimized for mobile. Use a phone or mobile simulator
- Adjust styles in component files if needed

### TypeScript errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure all type definitions are installed
- Check that your Node version is 14 or higher

## Next Steps

### Connect to Real Data

To connect this to a real backend:

1. Create API service layer in `src/services/api.ts`
2. Replace mock data imports with API calls
3. Add loading states and error handling
4. Implement authentication

### Add More Features

Ideas for expansion:
- Assignment creation interface
- Attendance marking
- Grade input forms
- Report generation
- Parent notifications
- Calendar/schedule view
- Analytics dashboard

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Review the component where the error occurs
3. Verify your data structure matches the TypeScript types
