## 🔄 Ready for Backend Integration

The app is structured to easily connect to a real backend:

**What you'll need to add:**
1. API service layer (`src/services/api.ts`)
2. Authentication system
3. State management (Context API or Redux)
4. Loading states
5. Error handling
6. Data persistence

**Current mock data functions can be replaced with:**
- `fetchClasses()` → API call
- `fetchStudents()` → API call
- `generateLeaderboard()` → API call
- `getDashboardStats()` → API call
